# 🎥 Quick Loom Video Script (5 minutes)

## Opening (30 seconds)

"Hey everyone! I'm going to show you the AI Research Orchestrator - a system I built that automates the entire research workflow. Instead of spending hours searching, reading, and writing reports, this does it all automatically in under a minute."

---

## What It Does (30 seconds)

"Here's the problem: when you need to research something, you have to:
- Break down your question
- Search multiple sources
- Read through articles
- Extract key information
- Write a structured report

This system does all of that automatically using a team of specialized AI agents."

---

## How It Works (1 minute)

"The system has five agents that work together:
1. **Planner** - Breaks your query into research topics and search queries
2. **Web Search** - Finds relevant articles and extracts content
3. **Analyzer** - Extracts key insights from the content
4. **Summarizer** - Creates a concise summary
5. **Report Generator** - Produces the final structured report

They're orchestrated using LangGraph, which manages the workflow and handles retries and errors."

## Live Demo (2 minutes)

"Let me show you with a real example. I'll ask: **'What are the latest fraud detection techniques in 2024?'**"

[Type query and press Enter]

"Now you can see it's processing. The system is:
- Planning the research approach
- Searching the web for relevant sources
- Extracting full content from those sources
- Analyzing for insights
- Summarizing findings
- Generating the report

This usually takes 30-60 seconds."

[Wait for results]

"Perfect! Here's the report. Look at this structure:
- **Introduction** - Sets the context
- **Background** - Relevant information
- **Key Findings** - Main discoveries
- **Trends** - Patterns identified
- **Challenges** - Obstacles found
- **Conclusion** - Synthesis
- **References** - All sources used

All of this was automatically generated from web search results. The system found articles, extracted insights, and organized them into this professional format."

## Technical Stack (30 seconds)

"Under the hood, this uses:
- **LangGraph** for orchestration
- **OpenAI GPT-4** for AI reasoning
- **Serper API** for web search
- **FAISS** for vector storage
- **Streamlit** for this interface

The code is modular - each agent is independent, making it easy to improve or add features."

---

## Use Cases (30 seconds)

"This is perfect for:
- Quick literature reviews
- Market research
- Competitive analysis
- Technical research
- Any scenario where you need to quickly understand a topic from multiple sources"

---

## Closing (15 seconds)

"That's the AI Research Orchestrator! It automates research workflows and generates comprehensive reports in seconds. Thanks for watching!"

---

## 🎯 Key Points to Emphasize

- **Automation**: "Saves hours of manual work"
- **Multi-Agent**: "Five specialized agents working together"
- **Structured**: "Consistent, professional output"
- **Sources**: "All sources tracked and cited"
- **Reliable**: "Error handling and retry logic"

---

## 💡 Tips

1. Have a good query ready (test it first!)
2. Let the system complete - don't rush
3. Scroll through the report to show structure
4. Be enthusiastic about the automation
5. Keep it around 5 minutes

Good luck! 🎬
